# Energy-Savings-Calculator
<div>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <h5>Getting Started</h5>
  <p>Our project was written partially with elements from Gradle, this requires the user to have the most recent version of Java 1.9.</p>
  <p>Download the jdk for the most recent version of Java 1.9. Import the project via a clone of the URI from github into Eclipse. Right click on the folder once it is imported, click properties, and make sure that 1.9 is the library it uses at runtime. </p>
  <p>In Eclipse, after importing into a folder under a name of your choice, open package <code>src/main/java</code>, open <com.unknown8.esc>, and you will find the <code>Main.java</code> needed to run the application.</p> 
  <h5>Using the Calculator</h5>
  <p>On the splash screen you have the option to either begin a new save file or open an existing file. </p>
  <p>When starting a new file, the user is prompted to enter several specifications of their current house and billing. All fields must have their required double, String, and ComboBox selection made before being allowed to continue. </p>
  <p>If the user wished to clear all choices made, the <code>Clear</code> button will reset all fields to their initial state.</p>
  <p><code>Confirm</code> will take all values entered and output a new bill based on the specifications and draw a model of the house. This output also shows how much the user saves with changing variables such as the number of windows and doors and the quality of them. The house drawn gives the user a visual look at their design with the specifications and can be used to compare to other visual aids of other houses drawn under different specifications.</p>
  <p>On the menu bar located at the top of the window, the user may click <code>File -> Save</code> or <code>File -> Save as...</code> to save their current work, to be opened later using <code>Open</code> on then splash screen or under <code>File -> Open</code> on the menu bar inside the currently running application.</p>
